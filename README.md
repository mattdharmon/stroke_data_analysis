#Stroke Data Analysis

Selected topic - Our group chose to analyze stroke data from a national database. We selected this topic because of our shared interest in healthcare. We realized that some of the tools acquired in this course would allow us to investigate this data in unique and informative ways. 
Description of their source of data - This data was pulled from Kaggle and is a private data source. It includes information such as age, gender, marital status, smoking history, avg blood sugar readings, known heart disease and whether or not the patient had a stroke. It lists data for about 5000 patients.
Questions we hope to answer with the data include identifying clusters of patients at risk for stroke and better understanding to what extent certain risk factors are predictive of stroke risk. 

# Outline
Our aim was to predict stroke outcomes based off of common risk factors. 
We determined to analyze our stroke data in the following steps:

1.  Find data - we chose stroke data because of our shared interest in healthcare
2.  Seek out comparable data for comparison
3.  Merge data
4.  Save to database on PostgreSQL (Amazon's document DB external access was outside of VCS and was prohibitive)
5.  Investigate descriptive stats using Tableau, Pandas, R, apply findings to presentation slides
6.  Scale model
7.  Run random forest, compare to other machine learning tools
8.  Present findings for final project
9.  Discuss with participants

## Meeting time.
Tuesday and Thursdays after class, otherwise as needed. We will use Slack to discuss our plan as often as daily in order to meet deadlines. 

## Communication
Chat through slack and use zoom to video chat. Use Trello to keep track of tasks.
